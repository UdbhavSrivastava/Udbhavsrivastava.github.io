								<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
                                <p>In today's dynamic economic landscape, accurate forecasting of key indicators such as the unemployment rate plays a crucial role in informing policy decisions, aiding businesses in strategic planning, and empowering individuals to navigate the job market effectively. Time series forecasting, a fundamental technique in predictive analytics, offers valuable insights into the future trends of such indicators. This project delves into the realm of time series forecasting for the unemployment rate, employing a multi-model approach to assess the performance and capabilities of various forecasting methodologies.</p>

                                        <h3><b>Stationarity Check</b></h3>
                                        <p>Stationarity check in time series refers to the process of assessing whether a time series data possesses stationarity, a key assumption in many time series analysis techniques. Stationarity implies that the statistical properties of a time series, such as its mean, variance, and autocovariance, remain constant over time.</p>
                                        <ul>

                                                <h4><b>Augmented Dickey Fuller Test</b></h4>
                                                <p>The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a statistical test commonly used in time series analysis to determine whether a given time series is stationary or not</p>
                                                <p><b>Null Hypothesis:</b> The null hypothesis of the ADF test is that the time series has a unit root, indicating that it is non-stationary. In other words, if the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, it suggests that the time series is non-stationary and exhibits a unit root, implying a linear trend or dependence on past values.</p>
                                                <p><b>Alternate Hypothesis:</b> The alternative hypothesis of the ADF test is that the time series is stationary, meaning it does not have a unit root. Rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis indicates that the time series is likely stationary.</p>

                                                <p>The Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test is another statistical test used in time series analysis to assess the stationarity of a time series data. Unlike the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, which tests for the presence of a unit root (indicating non-stationarity), the KPSS test evaluates the null hypothesis of stationarity against the alternative hypothesis of non-stationarity around a deterministic trend.</p>
                                                <p><b>Null Hypothesis:</b> The null hypothesis of the KPSS test is that the time series is stationary around a deterministic trend. In other words, the null hypothesis assumes that the time series is stationary, except for possible trend components.</p>
                                                <p><b>Alternate Hypothesis:</b> The alternative hypothesis of the KPSS test is that the time series has a unit root or is non-stationary around a deterministic trend. Rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis suggests non-stationarity.</p>

This decomposition process helps in understanding the various patterns and trends present in the data, making it easier to model and forecast the series accurately.</p>

                                <p>Based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values you provided, it seems that the TimeGPT model outperforms other models in forecasting unemployment rates. With an RMSE of 0.4617, TimeGPT has the lowest error compared to other models like AR, MA, ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM. Therefore, it can be concluded that the transformer-based TimeGPT model is the most efficient for forecasting unemployment rates based on the given data.</p>
