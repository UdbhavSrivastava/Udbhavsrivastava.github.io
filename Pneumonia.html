                                        <p>Automating the pneumonia classification process through deep learning can help reduce the workload on healthcare professionals, allowing them to focus their time and expertise on more complex cases or tasks requiring human judgment.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4><b>Efficient Screening</b></h4>
                                        <p>The developed model could serve as a screening tool to assist healthcare professionals in quickly identifying potential pneumonia cases. This could be particularly beneficial in settings with limited access to specialized medical expertise or resources, enabling earlier intervention and treatment.</p>
                                    </li>

                                <h2><b>Methodologies</b></h2>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4><b>Model Architecture</b></h4>
                                        <p>The model architecture chosen for this task is <b>ResNet-18</b>, a widely used CNN architecture known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The model was modified to accept single-channel input, as the medical images are likely grayscale.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4><b>Data Preprocessing</b></h4>
                                        <p>Training, validation, and test datasets were preprocessed using standard techniques, including normalization and conversion to tensors. Data augmentation techniques such as random horizontal flipping and rotation were considered but ultimately excluded from the final pipeline.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4><b>Loss Function and Optimizer</b></h4>
                                        <p>The loss function utilized for training the model is AUCMLoss, which is well-suited for optimizing multi-class area under the curve (AUC) metrics. The optimizer employed is <b>PESG (Parameter Efficient Stochastic Gradient)</b>, configured with specific hyperparameters to enhance model convergence and performance.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4><b>Training and Evaluation:</b></h4>
                                        <p>The training process involved iterating through multiple epochs, monitoring performance on training, validation, and test sets. <b>AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)</b> was chosen as the primary evaluation metric due to its robustness in binary classification tasks.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                <ul>
                                    <p>After training the model for the specified number of epochs, the following results were obtained:</p>
                                    <center>
                                        <img src="images/Pneumoniaoutput.png" alt="" width="700">
                                    </center>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                    <p>Final Training AUC: <b>0.9912</b></p> 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                    <p>Final Test AUC: <b>0.9216</b></p>
                                    </li>
                                    <p>These results indicate strong performance of the model in distinguishing between pneumonia and non-pneumonia cases. The high training AUC suggests that the model has effectively learned the underlying patterns in the training data. The slightly lower test AUC indicates that the model generalizes well to unseen data, though there may be some degree of overfitting.</p>
                                </ul>
                            <h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
                                <p>In conclusion, the developed deep learning model demonstrates promising performance in pneumonia classification based on medical images. With a final test AUC of <b>0.9216</b>, the model exhibits strong discriminative ability and holds potential for aiding in the accurate diagnosis of pneumonia cases.</p>
